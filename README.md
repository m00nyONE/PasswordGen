# PasswordGen
A simple & lightweight bash script to generate secure passwords in a given length and/or output them to a file.
It uses the urandom device in your linux system to generate the passwords. It just greps characters out and joins them together.


# It also works as a Portable script, you don't need to install it before using

Download the script from the Browser directly or use git

	mkdir /tmp/pwgen
	git clone https://github.com/m00nyONE/PasswordGen.git /tmp/pwgen/
	cd /tmp/pwgen/PasswordGen
	chmod +x pwgen
	./pwgen

# Installation:
Dependencies: You need the git package for the updater/installer to work

	Debian/Ubuntu: 	apt-get install git
	Arch Linux:	pacman -S git
	Fedora: 	dnf -y install git
	Redhat:		yum install git
	Suse:		zypper in git-core
